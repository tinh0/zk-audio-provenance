## VerITAS KZG
This implementation is a fork of the github repository VerITAS found <a href="https://github.com/zk-VerITAS/VerITAS/tree/22e9895e99490bfebfb468cb0425d855a577c742">here</a>.

This directory contains the Full System Implementation for VerITAS's proof system with the KZG Univariate PCS. The original imlpementation only had code for one-channel image transformation proofs and hash pre-image proofs. We took their one-channel code from the original repository, and made 3-channel variants via parallelization (as is suggested in the VerITAS paper) to enable a fair comparison with HyperVerITAS. 

## VerITAS KZG Setup

1) Ensure you are in the directory: `HyperVerITAS/comparisons/VerITAS_KZG`

2) Run the setup script as follows:
   
  ```
  ./veritas_kzg_setup.sh
  ```

## Benchmarks

1) Ensure that you are in the `HyperVerITAS/comparisons/VerITAS_KZG` directory.

2) To run the Full System Implementation for VerITAS KZG, run the following commands:

- Crop:

  ```
  /usr/bin/time -v cargo run --release --example fullCropKZG <size>
  ```

- Grayscale:

  ```
  /usr/bin/time -v cargo run --release --example fullGrayKZG <size>
  ```

- Note `<size>` is the input size (2^size number of pixels). Valid choices are numbers between 19-25.

- The command will print out the **Prover Runtime**, **Verifier Runtime**, **Proof Size**, and **Prover Peak Memory**, the four metrics we record in our paper. The prover peak memory is output in the line titled `Maximum resident set size (kbytes)`.
